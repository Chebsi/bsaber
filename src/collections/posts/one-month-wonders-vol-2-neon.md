After a successful first edition, the BSM Discord has decided to host the second edition of your favorite competition event on BSM! We are proud to present: “One Month Wonders Vol. 2: Neon”!

In this one-month-long competition, teams of mappers have to create maps that fit strict requirements. This time around, mappers had to make their maps fit a Neon theme, this meant vibrant light colors, chiptune music, and a bit of Noodle Extensions on top of that. Available environments were limited to see how creative mappers can be with Chroma Environment Enhancements.
